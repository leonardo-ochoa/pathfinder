## CSE 331 hw-setup Questions
## Part 7: Answering Questions About the Code

1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test? What (if anything) did
you have to do to fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

The Fibonacci failed the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException test because it was throwing this exceptions for
zero which is not a negative number. The original test was n <= 0 and since 0 is not negative I just swithced it
too n < 0 to fix it.

2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix
it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

The original base case was to return 1 if n <= 2. This is wrong becasue only the 0th and 1st index should have return
1. The index to should return another number so to fix it I changed it to n < 2.

3.Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

TestInductiveCase was done correctly. The only part that failed was when we tested for when n was 2. This would return
1 because it was processed in the base case rather than the inductive case. In the inductive case nothing was changed.

## Part 8: Debugger Tutorial

1. What are the values of "x", "y", and "sum" printed by your statement? Why was x not equal 
to the first integer entered here, and how could we fix this?

x = 4, y =4, and sum = 0. x was not equal to five here because the integer x is saved as 2 * (console.nextInt() / 2).
What this means is the odd numbers will always be 1 integer less since we divide by 2 on an integer division.
To fix this we could just set x = console.nextInt();

2. What are all the names and values listed in the “Variables” panel? What does the “frames” 
tab list as the current method and line number? (Write down the text that was highlighted when 
the Debug perspective first opened.)

The names are x =3 and y = 4. The frames tab lists the current method as computeSum:42, Adder(setup).

3. What are all the names and values listed in the “Variables” panel after each of the two step overs?

First step over:
args
console
x = 3
y = 4

Second step over:
args
console
x = 3
y = 4
sum = -1
