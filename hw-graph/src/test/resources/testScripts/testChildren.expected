#tests a graph can be created
#able to add nodes and edges
#tests different children of multiple nodes

# Create a graph
created graph A

# Add 4 of nodes
added node n1 to A
added node n2 to A
added node n3 to A
added node n4 to A

# add edges to n1
added edge e13 from n1 to n3 in A
added edge e12 from n1 to n2 in A
added edge e11 from n1 to n1 in A

#add edges to n2
added edge e12 from n2 to n3 in A
added edge e12 from n2 to n3 in A

#add edges to n3
added edge e341 from n3 to n4 in A
added edge e342 from n3 to n4 in A
added edge e343 from n3 to n4 in A

# list children of n1
the children of n1 in A are: n1(e11) n2(e12) n3(e13)

# list children of n2
the children of n2 in A are: n3(e12)

# list children of n3
the children of n3 in A are: n4(e341) n4(e342) n4(e343)

# list children of n4
the children of n4 in A are:
